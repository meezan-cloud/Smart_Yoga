# 🧘‍♀️ Smart Yoga  
### AI-Powered Pose Detection & Recommendation System

**Smart Yoga** is an intelligent web application designed to act as a personal yoga assistant. It solves the problem of performing yoga incorrectly at home by providing real-time AI pose recognition and offers personalized routine recommendations based on health metrics.

## 1. 🧠 AI Pose Recognition (Dual-Model Architecture)

### • Image Upload Analysis  
Upload a photo of a yoga pose, and the system identifies it with **91%+ accuracy**.  
- *Powered by:* A Main SVM Model trained on **28 classes** (27 Yoga Poses + 1 "Other" class for robustness).

### • Live Webcam Coach  
Real-time detection using your webcam with **zero lag**.  
- *Powered by:* A Specialist SVM Model trained on **9 key classes** for high-speed performance (96% accuracy).  
- *Smart Filtering:* Includes logic to detect if the user is just sitting/standing (the "Other" class) or if the full body is not visible, preventing false positives.

## 2. 📋 Personalized Recommendation Engine

A rule-based expert system that generates safe yoga routines based on:

- **Health Profile:** Age, Sex, Pain Level (Low/Medium/High).  
- **Medical Conditions:** Filters poses based on disorders (e.g., Back Pain, Stress, Obesity).  
- **BMI Analysis:** Automatically calculates BMI. If BMI ≥ 25, the system strictly recommends **"Joint-Friendly"** poses to prevent injury.

## 3. 🔐 User System

- Secure User Registration and Login  
- Data stored in a local SQLite database

# 📊 AI Methodology & Approach

## Why MediaPipe + SVM?

Instead of using a heavy Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on raw pixels, we utilized a **Hybrid AI Approach**:

1. **Feature Extraction:**  
   We use Google's **MediaPipe Pose** to detect 33 body keypoints (skeleton) and convert the image into a lightweight vector of **132 numbers** (x, y, z, visibility).

2. **Classification:**  
   We trained a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier on this landmark data.

---

## Performance Comparison (The "Bake-Off")

We tested 7 different algorithms on our dataset. The **SVM (SVC)** proved to be superior:

- **SVM Accuracy:** 91.51% (Winner)  
- **Neural Network (MLP):** 88.86% (Slower to train)  
- **Random Forest:** 85.94%

---

## The "Specialist" Strategy

To ensure the live webcam feature was fast and accurate, we trained a separate **Specialist Model**.  
While the main model knows 28 classes, the specialist model focuses only on the 9 specific poses used in the live feature.  
This reduced confusion and boosted accuracy to **96.94%**.
